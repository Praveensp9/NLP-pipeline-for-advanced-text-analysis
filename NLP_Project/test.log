i have tried all types of raw dog food for my yorkie he used to like the paw naturaw grassfed bison meals but the last two bags i received had to be mixed with fresh raw meat in order for him to eat it i tried stella chewy s freeze dried raw meals and ended up having to do the same with that food this morning i put out a small portion of ziwipeak real meat grain free air dried raw dog food venison fish from a lb bag and my yorkie gobbled it up shipping was quick too i order on monday and received it on tuesday i am very pleased with the product and the shipment br br i am sold on this product and will definitely order this again
i tried these for the first time about a year ago then my market stopped carrying them lack of shelf space so i took the web address off the package and ordered online no way i was going to miss out on this delicious and amazing chip i even saw a program on how they were made and loved it even more the best not too spicy crisp and crunchy simply terrific
my parents both love chocolate and drink fine drinks every now and then so i figured this would be a great gift you ll have to ask them how they taste but on my end this was a great product br br pros br quick shipment br excellent presentation in the box br great selection of liquers grand mariner stolichnaya orange great with chocolate i presume jim beam and remy martin br br cons br lots of tape on actual product took some work to remove without messing up the label or wood br br great product overall would be great gift for parents or any chocolate lover
totally orgasmic these chips are the best spicy chip i have ever tasted signed up for the subscribe and save option the case contained fifteen full sized bags of chips the price per unit equals per package that is not even the cost of plain chips if you add the free shipping and the fast delivery this deal is a steal so run like you stole something over to your computer and order the spicy thai chips p s even if you paid the going price of you are still ahead of the curve enjoy
i purchased this product and found the pancakes dry this item is overpriced for the amount you get try another brand
although everything in basket was really tasty all products were very small in portion and very expensive would not recommend
bold is bold is bold yet smooth typically i am leery of celebrity products but i have ordered and reordered this product and it has been consistent over time well priced and is bold but not overly barky enjoy
these chocolates are much better than stars br br we found a leonidas shop during a visit to brussels belgium earlier this year and brought home of the kilo assortment ballotins i was ready to call directly to brussels to place an order for more but found them in new york city so no need to search further br br the quality is outstanding and as other have already stated far superior to other brands and much more affordable br br the shipment arrives overnight and each ballotin is protected in it s own styrofoam case br br try an assortment the dark is unbelievably decadent and you will not be disappointed br br enjoy
iced or hot you can t get a more flavorful tea it is peachy but tastes tropical to me as well my whole family likes this particular flavor the best i m so happy to find it here
had to break the slices in half for my terrier the breaking in half left sharp points which i rounded off with scissors might be better for large dogs dogs love the taste but will never buy the slices again and will stick to the shape of fr fries which are thinner and easier to chew and safer
tasty slightly different flavors then other brands but good in all other respects good purchase hard to find in us so i am not too picky
packaging was very good comes in separate well sealed containers bags in a cardboard box i liked that it s divided into portions which means freshness it s much cheaper than buying it from all local big and small shops i ve bought it from and is fresher br br my mom has always boiled some anise when someone had a stomachache and it seemed to work i make a big pot and warm up a cup after certain meals that are a little heavy on the stomach or are gassy hope this helps
bought this box of chips as a father s day gift because dad loves them they are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips
be aware that if you think you re going to get green mountain coffee roasters gourmet single cup milk chocolate hot chocolate k cup box pack of boxes you won t liquid nation sends out cafe express milk chocolate hot chocolate and doesn t tell you they are going to substitute then when you contact them about it they tell you green mountain is being phased out and replaced with cafe express and they don t care if you re unhappy about the switch
got this on sale at my local grocery store to try it out wow love this cereal perfect amount of crunchiness sweetness and fiberness i really like the flavor and sweetness of the yogurt pieces aside from the possibility of extra gas this is an incredible cereal
i do not know a whole lot about dog food but i try to avoid corn because i noticed it makes my dogs stink br br this very much looks like a quality dog food in its texture from the ingredients listed and the fact that it s not bone dry like some of the cheaper dry foods it reminds me of some of the premium brands in its color texture and this is a bit gross but the compactness darker color of what came out of the dogs after they started eating it br br i like it the dogs are eating it and doing well on it i will definitely be buying it as their regular dog food from now on the price is probably better than the other store premium brands because there is no advertising br br i recommend it
the coffee was purchased as part of a promotional from the grocery section of amazon we were pleasantly surprised with the tastefullness of the coffee itself while we are fans of coffee from costa rica we had never tried this brand before for the price the purchase was a good one and we were pleasantly happy with trying something outside of the norm
my month old aussie border collie mix puppy liked this game a lot it s pretty durable you hide the treats in the cups and your pup has to find them i think the best part about this game is that it is games in some of the games were easier for him to understand how to play quicker than others my puppy was able to learn all of the games pretty quickly the instructions and set up are simple i wish there were more of the green cups though one more note i got mine from cvs for and change but that was the first time i have seen a dog game sold in mainstream stores so buying online form amazon might be a good option if you dont feel like store hopping to try to find it overall i am happy with my purchase and love the idea of playing games with my puppy
i didnt think that it was going to be very good because br we arent a big velveeta cheese family br my kids helped make it super easy br by the end of dinner there were no leftovers br br my kids even asked me to buy some more br so we recommend this for everyone
ok after eating blair s death rain hot wing chips this is like eating a cracker that aside these are a pretty good chip especially if you don t like em hot and spicy these are tangy crunchy and hard to stop eating
i ve been an espresso freak since i first tried one after viewing the godfather part ii don fanucci downs it in one gulp while talking to the young vito coreleone i used to go to starbucks every morning but i eventually decided to buy my own machine espressione cafe retro and brew my own i gravited to pods because they were so much easier and less messy than ground coffee i buy the sampler packs from podmerchant exclusively but not because i am attempting through scientific research to find the best brand there is no best brand sometimes i want something light and tangy so i ll reach for an attibassi nicaragua maybe a rich heavy blast after a big meal gotta be a lucaffe mr exclusive early afternoon is the perfect time for a cafe mako napoletano i like the variety i like the colorful packaging i like to be surprised and not know what s coming ne
